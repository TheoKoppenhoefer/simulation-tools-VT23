# simulation-tools-VT23
This is a repository of a great team in the simulation tools course at Lund, HT23.

## Some TODO's for project 1
- [ ] refer to stability regions
- [ ] remove the noise in the last energy plot
- [ ] remove reference to stability index
- [ ] revise conclusion
- [ ] write introduction


## Some TODO's for project 2
- [ ] insert a picture of the problem
- [ ] Check result of task 3
- [ ] Task 8
- [ ] compare solution plots of the explicit solver
- [ ] find out more in the documentation of IDA on the parameters algvar and atol.
- [ ] Compare the solution of RK4 with the other solutions


## Some TODO's for project 3
- [ ] Task 4: Comparison plots
- [ ] check the damping behaviour
- [ ] rename stability index
- [ ] write introduction
